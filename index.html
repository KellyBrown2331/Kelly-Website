  <p>I have to be honest, parenting during this pandemic has had some challenging moments. Especially when we have to keep our distance, my toddler hasn't been able to play with friends for months at a time in the past year.

<ul>
  <li>Home</li>
  <li>About</li>
  <li>Activities</li>
  <li>Recipes</li>
</ul>

<p>If you are at home with your toddler, you may need some ideads to keep them busy.
